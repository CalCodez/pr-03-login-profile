He's a master of gadgets, vehicles, and weaponry, constantly tinkering and creating solutions to the team's problems.
Donatello's intelligence and resourcefulness make him a valuable asset to the team.

He's also known for being the most reclusive and socially awkward of the brothers, often lost in his own thoughts or working on his inventions.
While Donatello is fiercely independent and analytical, he's also deeply caring and protective of his brothers, especially when they're in danger. He's often seen as the voice of reason and logic within the team, trying to mediate between his brothers' different personalities and prevent them from fighting. He's also known for his strong connection to April O'Neil, whom he often sees as a friend and confidante.

Leo's leadership is not just about fighting; he also values his family and their well-being above all else. He's the voice of reason within the group, often mediating disagreements between his brothers and keeping them focused on their mission. While he can be a bit serious and rule-oriented, he also possesses a strong sense of humor and camaraderie with his brothers.

Michelangelo's catchphrase, "Cowabunga!", is a testament to his enthusiastic and energetic personality. He also frequently uses the catchphrase, "I love being a turtle!". He embodies the spirit of the TMNT, demonstrating that you can be both serious and fun-loving, capable and playful.

	contentText: `Raph's personality is characterized by his short fuse and tendency to snap when things don't go his way. He's particularly prone to teasing Michelangelo, often referred to as "little brother," but their relationship is closer than it appears. Raph also has a protective side, evident in his willingness to risk himself for his brothers and Sensei Splinter.
In many iterations, Raph is the most violent and least patient of the turtles. He's known for his relentless fighting style and lack of patience for stealth or strategy. However, he's also a good person who deeply loves his family and would do anything to protect them, even if he doesn't always show it.
Raph's struggles often stem from his pride and reluctance to admit his emotions. He can be easily overwhelmed and prone to choking under pressure. Despite his flaws, he's a crucial part of the team and a source of strength and protection for his brothers.
In the 2012 series, Raph's chip in his shell is a result of a past injury sustained during an accident with the Kraang. He also has a history of pet ownership, including Spike who later mutated into Slash, and Chompy. His most defining character trait is his bad temper, often directed at Mikey, and his occasional feuds with Leonardo and Donatello. `,
